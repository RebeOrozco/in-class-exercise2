    <p>Not a great plan. When they come and they will...<em>they'll come for you.</em></p>
    <p><br>I have an army.</p> 
    <p><br><b>We have a Hulk.</b></p> 
    <p><br>I thought the beast had wandered off.</p> 
    <p><strong>You're missing the point!</strong> <br>There's no <i>throne</i>, there is no version of this where you come out on top.</p> 
    <p><br>Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us but it's all on you.</p>
    <p><br>Because if we can't protect the Earth, <b>you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it!</b></p>
    <p><br><em>How will you friends have time for me... when they're so busy fighting you?</em></p>
