    <p>Not a great plan. When they come and they will...they'll come for you. <br>I have an army. <br>We have a Hulk. <br>I thought the beast had wandered off. 
      <strong>You're missing the point!</strong> <br>There's no <i>throne</i>, there is no version of this where you come out on top. 
      <br>Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us but it's all on you.
      <br>Because if we can't protect the Earth, <b>you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it!</b>
      <br><em>How will you friends have time for me... when they're so busy fighting you?</em>
